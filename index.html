        Hello! My name is Joel Morales. I enjoy learning new things, especially when it comes to technology. 
        I'm currently taking a few classes this summer to learn more about web development and networking. 
        I also really enjoy playing video games on my spare time. Staying active is important to me, so I like going on walks in the morning.
        I'm excited to keep growing and trying new hobbies as I get older.
